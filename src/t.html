<p>A prince am I of ancestry renowned,</p>
<p>Illustrious name my royal sire hath found.</p>
<p>When Sirius did in spring its light display,</p>
<p>A child was born, and Tiger marked the day.</p>
<p>When first upon my face my lord's eye glanced,</p>
<p>For me auspicious names he straight advanced,</p>
<p>Denoting that in me Heaven's marks divine</p>
<p>Should with the virtues of the earth combine.</p>
<p>With lavished innate qualities indued,</p>
<p>By art and skill my talents I renewed;</p>
<p>Angelic herbs and sweet selineas too,</p>
<p>And orchids late that by the water grew,</p>
<p>I wove for ornament; till creeping Time,</p>
<p>Like water flowing, stole away my prime.</p>
<p>Magnolias of the glade I plucked at dawn,</p>
<p>At eve beside the stream took winter-thorn.</p>
<p>Without delay the sun and moon sped fast,</p>
<p>In swift succession spring and autumn passed;</p>
<p>The fallen flowers lay scattered on the ground,</p>
<p>The dusk might fall before my dream was found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had I not loved my prime and spurned the vile,</p>
<p>Why should I not have changed my former style?</p>
<p>My chariot drawn by steeds of race divine</p>
<p>I urged; to guide the king my sole design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three ancient kings there were so pure and true</p>
<p>That round them every fragrant flower grew;</p>
<p>Cassia and pepper of the mountain-side </p>
<p>With melilotus white in clusters vied.</p>
<p>Two monarchs then, who high renown received,</p>
<p>Followed the kingly way, their goal achieved.</p>
<p>Two princes proud by lust their reign abused,</p>
<p>Sought easier path, and their own steps confused.</p>
<p>The faction for illict pleasure longed;</p>
<p>Dreadful their way where hidden perils thronged.</p>
<p>Danger against myself could not appal,</p>
<p>But feared I lest my sovereign's sceptre fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forward and back I hastened in my quest,</p>
<p>Followed the former kings, and took no rest.</p>
<p>The prince my true integrity defamed,</p>
<p>Gave ear to slander, high his anger flamed;</p>
<p>Integrity I knew could not avail,</p>
<p>Yet still endured; my lord I would not fail.</p>
<p>Celestial spheres my witness be on high,</p>
<p>I strove but for his sacred majesty.</p>
<p>Twas first to me he gave his plighted word,</p>
<p>But soon repenting other counsel heard.</p>
<p>For me departure could arouse no pain;</p>
<p>I grieved to see his royal purpose vain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nine fields of orchids at one time I grew,</p>
<p>For melilot a hundred acres too,</p>
<p>And fifty acres for the azalea bright,</p>
<p>The rumex fragrant and the lichen white.</p>
<p>I longed to see them yielding blossoms rare,</p>
<p>And thought in season due the spoil to share.</p>
<p>I did not grieve to see them die away,</p>
<p>But grieved because midst weeds they did decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insatiable in lust and greediness</p>
<p>The faction strove, and tired not of excess;</p>
<p>Themselves condoning, others they'd decry,</p>
<p>And steep their hearts in envious jealousy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insatiably they seized what they desired,</p>
<p>It was not that to which my heart aspired.</p>
<p>As old age unrelenting hurried near,</p>
<p>Lest my fair name should fail was all my fear.</p>
<p>Dew from magnolia leaves I drank at dawn,</p>
<p>At eve for food were aster petals borne;</p>
<p>And loving thus the simple and the fair,</p>
<p>How should I for my sallow features care?</p>
<p>With gathered vines I strung valeria white,</p>
<p>And mixed with blue wistaria petals bright,</p>
<p>And melilotus matched with cassia sweet,</p>
<p>With ivy green and tendrils long to meet.</p>
<p>Life I adapted to the ancient way,</p>
<p>Leaving the manners of the present day;</p>
<p>Thus unconforming to the modern age,</p>
<p>The path I followed of a bygone sage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long did I sigh and wipe away my tears,</p>
<p>To see my people bowed by griefs and fears.</p>
<p>Though I my gifts enhanced and curbed my pride,</p>
<p>At morn they'd mock me, would at eve deride;</p>
<p>First cursed that I angelica should wear,</p>
<p>Then cursed me for my melilotus fair.</p>
<p>But since my heart did love such purity,</p>
<p>I'd not regret a thousand deaths to die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I marvel at the folly of the king,</p>
<p>So heedless of his people's suffering.</p>
<p>They envied me my mothlike eyebrows fine,</p>
<p>And so my name his damsels did malign.</p>
<p>Truly to craft alone their praise they paid,</p>
<p>The square in measuring they disobeyed;</p>
<p>The use of common rules they held debased;</p>
<p>With confidence their crooked lines they traced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In sadness plunged and sunk in deepest gloom,</p>
<p>Alone I drove on to my dreary doom.</p>
<p>In exile rather would I meet my end,</p>
<p>Than to the baseness of their ways descend.</p>
<p>Remote the eagle spurns the common range,</p>
<p>Nor deigns since time began its way to change;</p>
<p>A circle fits not with a square design;</p>
<p>Their different ways could not be merged with mine.</p>
<p>Yet still my heart I checked and curbed my pride,</p>
<p>Their blame endured and their reproach beside.</p>
<p>To die for righteousness alone I sought,</p>
<p>For this was what the ancient sages taught.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I failed my former errors to discern;</p>
<p>I tarried long, but now I would return.</p>
<p>My steeds I wheeled back to their former way,</p>
<p>Lest all too long down the wrong path I stray.</p>
<p>On orchid-covered bank I loosed my steed,</p>
<p>And let him gallop by the flow'ry mead</p>
<p>At will. Rejected now and in disgrace,</p>
<p>I would retire to cultivate my grace.</p>
<p>With cress leaves green my simple gown I made,</p>
<p>With lilies white my rustic garb did braid.</p>
<p>Why should I grieve to go unrecognised,</p>
<p>Since in my heart fragrance was truly prized?</p>
<p>My headdress then high-pinnacled I raised,</p>
<p>Lengthened my pendents, where bright jewels blazed.</p>
<p>Others may smirch their fragrance and bright hues,</p>
<p>My innocence is proof against abuse.</p>
<p>Oft I looked back, gazed to the distance still,</p>
<p>Longed in the wilderness to roam at will.</p>
<p>Splendid my ornaments together vied,</p>
<p>With all the fragrance of the flowers beside;</p>
<p>All men had pleasures in their various ways,</p>
<p>My pleasure was to cultivate my grace.</p>
<p>I would not change, though they my body rend;</p>
<p>How could my heart be wrested from its end?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My handmaid fair, with countenance demure,</p>
<p>Entreated me allegiance to abjure:</p>
<p>"A hero perished in the plain ill-starred,</p>
<p>Where pigmies stayed their plumage to discard.</p>
<p>Why lovest thou thy grace and purity,</p>
<p>Alone dost hold thy splendid virtue high?</p>
<p>Lentils and weeds the prince's chamber fill:</p>
<p>Why holdest thou aloof with stubborn will?</p>
<p>Thou canst not one by one the crowd persuade,</p>
<p>And who the purpose of our heart hath weighed?</p>
<p>Faction and strife the world hath ever loved;</p>
<p>Heeding me not, why standest thou removed?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sought th'ancestral voice to ease my woe.</p>
<p>Alas, how one so proud could sink so low!</p>
<p>To barbarous south I went across the stream;</p>
<p>Before the ancient I began my theme:</p>
<p>"With odes divine there came a monarch's son,</p>
<p>Whose revels unrestrained were never done;</p>
<p>In antics wild, to coming perils blind,</p>
<p>He fought his brother, and his sway declined.</p>
<p>The royal archer, in his wanton chase</p>
<p>For foxes huge, his kingdom did disgrace.</p>
<p>Such wantonness predicts no happy end;</p>
<p>His queen was stolen by his loyal friend.</p>
<p>The traitor's son, clad in prodigious might,</p>
<p>In incest sinned and cared not what was right.</p>
<p>He revelled all his days, forgetting all;</p>
<p>His head at last in treachery did fall.</p>
<p>And then the prince, who counsels disobeyed,</p>
<p>Did court disaster, and his kingdom fade.</p>
<p>A prince his sage in burning cauldrons tossed;</p>
<p>His glorious dynasty ere long was lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But stern and pious was their ancient sire,</p>
<p>And his successor too did faith inspire;</p>
<p>Exalted were the wise, the able used,</p>
<p>The rule was kept and never was abused.</p>
<p>The august heaven, with unbiassed grace,</p>
<p>All men discerns, and helps the virtuous race;</p>
<p>Sagacious princes through their virtuous deed</p>
<p>The earth inherit, and their reigns succeed.</p>
<p>The past I probed, the future so to scan,</p>
<p>And found these rules that guide the life of man:</p>
<p>A man unjust in deed who would engage?</p>
<p>Whom should men take as guide except the sage?</p>
<p>In mortal dangers death I have defied,</p>
<p>Yet could look back, and cast regret aside.</p>
<p>Who strove, their tool's defects accounting nought,</p>
<p>Like ancient sages were to cauldrons brought."</p>
<p>Thus I despaired, my face with sad tears marred,</p>
<p>Mourning with bitterness my years ill-starred;</p>
<p>And melilotus leaves I took to stem</p>
<p>The tears that streamed down to my garment's hem.</p>
<p>Soiling my gown, to plead my case I kneeled;</p>
<p>Th'ancestral voice the path to me revealed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swift jade-green dragons, birds with plumage gold,</p>
<p>I harnessed to the whirlwind, and behold,</p>
<p>At daybreak from the land of plane-trees grey,</p>
<p>I came to paradise ere close of day.</p>
<p>I wished within the sacred brove to rest,</p>
<p>But now the sun was sinking in the west;</p>
<p>The driver of the sun I bade to stay,</p>
<p>Ere with the setting rays we haste away.</p>
<p>The way was long, and wrapped in gloom did seem,</p>
<p>As I urged on to seek my vanished dream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dragons quenched their thirst beside the lake</p>
<p>Where bathed the sun, whilst I upon the brake</p>
<p>Fastened my reins; a golden bough I sought</p>
<p>To brush the sun, and tarred there in sport.</p>
<p>The pale moon's charioteer I then bade lead,</p>
<p>The master of the winds swiftly succeed;</p>
<p>Before, the royal blue bird cleared the way;</p>
<p>The lord of thunder urged me to delay.</p>
<p>I bade the phoenix scan the heaven wide;</p>
<p>But vainly day and night its course it tried;</p>
<p>The gathering whirlwinds drove it from my sight,</p>
<p>Rushing with lowering clouds to check my flight;</p>
<p>Sifting and merging in the firmament,</p>
<p>Above, below, in various hues they went.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gate-keeper of heaven I bade give place,</p>
<p>But leaning on his door he scanned my face;</p>
<p>The day grew dark, and now was nearly spent;</p>
<p>Idly my orchids into wreaths I bent.</p>
<p>The virtuous and the vile in darkness merged;</p>
<p>They veiled my virtue, by their envy urged.</p>
<p>At dawn the waters white I left behind;</p>
<p>My steed stayed by the portals of the wind;</p>
<p>Yet, gazing back, a bitter grief I felt</p>
<p>That in the lofty crag no damsel dwelt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wandered eastward to the palace green,</p>
<p>And pendents sought where jasper boughs were seen,</p>
<p>And vowed that they, before their splendour fade,</p>
<p>As gift should go to grace the loveliest maid.</p>
<p>The lord of clouds I then bade mount the sky</p>
<p>To seek the steam where once the nymph did lie;</p>
<p>As pledge I gave my belt of splendid sheen,</p>
<p>My councillor appointed go-between.</p>
<p>Fleeting and wilful like capricious cloud,</p>
<p>Her obstinacy swift no change allowed.</p>
<p>At dusk retired she to the crag withdrawn,</p>
<p>Her hair beside the stream she washed at dawn.</p>
<p>Exulting in her beauty and her pride,</p>
<p>Pleasure she worshipped, and no whim denied;</p>
<p>So fair of form, so careless of all grace,</p>
<p>I turned to take another in her place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To earth's extremities I sought my bride,</p>
<p>And urged my train through all the heaven wide.</p>
<p>Upon a lofty crag of jasper green</p>
<p>The beauteous princess of the west was seen.</p>
<p>The falcon then I bade entreat the maid,</p>
<p>But he, demurring, would my course dissuade;</p>
<p>The turtle-dove cooed soft and off did fly,</p>
<p>But I mistrusted his frivolity.</p>
<p>Like whelp in doubt, like timid fox in fear,</p>
<p>I wished to go, but wandered ever near.</p>
<p>With nuptial gifts the phoenix swiftly went;</p>
<p>I feared the prince had won her ere I sent.</p>
<p>I longed to travel far, yet with no bourn,</p>
<p>I could but wander aimless and forlorn.</p>
<p>Before the young king was in marriage bound,</p>
<p>The royal sisters twain might still be found;</p>
<p>My suit was unauspicious at the best;</p>
<p>I knew I had small hope in my request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is dark, and envious of my grace;</p>
<p>They veil my virture and the evil praise.</p>
<p>Thy chamber dark lies in recesses deep,</p>
<p>Sagacious prince, risest thou not from sleep?</p>
<p>My zeal unknown the prince would not descry;</p>
<p>How could I bear this harsh eternity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With mistletoe and herbs of magic worth,</p>
<p>I urged the witch the future to show forth.</p>
<p>"If two attain perfection they must meet,</p>
<p>But who is there that would thy virtue greet?</p>
<p>Far the nine continents their realm display;</p>
<p>Why here to seek thy bride doth thou delay?</p>
<p>Away!" she cried, "set craven doubt aside,</p>
<p>If beauty's sought, there's none hath with thee vied.</p>
<p>What place is there where orchids flower not fair?</p>
<p>Why is thy native land thy single care?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now darkly lies the world in twilight's glow,</p>
<p>Who doth your defects and your virtue know?</p>
<p>Evil and good herein are reconciled;</p>
<p>The crowd alone hath nought but is defiled.</p>
<p>With stinking mugwort girt upon their waist,</p>
<p>They curse the others for their orchids chaste;</p>
<p>Ignorant thus in choice of fragrance rare,</p>
<p>Rich ornaments how could they fitly wear?</p>
<p>With mud and filth they fill their pendent bag;</p>
<p>Cursing the pepper sweet, they brawl and brag.</p>
<p>" Although the witches counsel I held good,</p>
<p>In foxlike indecision still I stood.</p>
<p>At night the wizard great made his descent,</p>
<p>And meeting him spiced rice I did present.</p>
<p>The angels came, shading with wings the sky;</p>
<p>From mountains wild the deities drew nigh.</p>
<p>With regal splendour shone the solemn sight,</p>
<p>And thus the wizard spake with omens bright:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Take office high or low as days afford,</p>
<p>If one there be that could with thee accord;</p>
<p>Like ancient kings austere who sought their mate,</p>
<p>Finding the one who should fulfill their fate.</p>
<p>Now if thy heart doth cherish grace within,</p>
<p>What need is there to choose a go-between?</p>
<p>A convict toiled on rocks to expiate</p>
<p>His crime; his sovereign gave him great estate.</p>
<p>A butcher with his knife made roundelay;</p>
<p>His king chanced there and happy proved the day.</p>
<p>A prince who heard a cowherd chanting late</p>
<p>Raised him to be a councillor of state.</p>
<p>Before old age o'ertake thee on thy way,</p>
<p>Life still is young; to profit turn thy day.</p>
<p>Spring is but brief, when cuckoos start to sing,</p>
<p>And flowers will fade that once did spread and spring."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On high my jasper pendent proudly gleamed,</p>
<p>Hid by the crowd with leaves that thickly teemed;</p>
<p>Untiring they relentless means employed;</p>
<p>I feared it would through envy be destroyed.</p>
<p>This gaudy age so fickle proved its will,</p>
<p>That to what purpose did I linger still?</p>
<p>E'en orchids changed, their fragrance quickly lost,</p>
<p>And midst the weeds angelicas were tossed.</p>
<p>How could these herbs, so fair in former day,</p>
<p>Their hue have changed, and turned to mugworts grey?</p>
<p>The reason for their fall, not far to seek,</p>
<p>Was that to tend their grace their will proved weak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought upon the orchids I might lean;</p>
<p>No flowers appeared, but long bare leaves were seen;</p>
<p>Their grace abandoned, vulgar taste to please,</p>
<p>Content with lesser flowers to dwell at ease.</p>
<p>To boasts and flattery the pepper turned;</p>
<p>To fill the pendent bag the dogwood yearned;</p>
<p>Thus only upon higher stations bent,</p>
<p>How could they long retain their former scent?</p>
<p>Since they pursued the fashion of the time,</p>
<p>Small wonder they decayed e'en in their prime.</p>
<p>Viewing the orchids' and the peppers' plight</p>
<p>Why blame the rumex and selinea white?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My jasper pendent rare I was beguiled</p>
<p>To leave, and to this depth then sank defiled.</p>
<p>It blossomed still and never ceased to grow;</p>
<p>Like water did its lovely fragrance flow:</p>
<p>Pleasure I took to wear this bough in sport,</p>
<p>As roaming wild the damsel fair I sought.</p>
<p>Thus in my prime, with ornaments bedecked,</p>
<p>I roved the earth and heaven to inspect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With omens bright the seer revealed the way,</p>
<p>I then appointed an auspicious day.</p>
<p>As victuals rare some jasper twigs I bore,</p>
<p>And some prepared, provision rich to store;</p>
<p>Then winged horses to my chariot brought</p>
<p>My carriage bright with jade and ivory wrought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How might tow hearts at variance accord?</p>
<p>I roamed till peace be to my mind restored.</p>
<p>The pillar of the earth I stayed beside;</p>
<p>The way was long, and winding far and wide.</p>
<p>In twilight glowed the clouds with wondrous sheen,</p>
<p>And chirping flew the birds of jasper green.</p>
<p>I went at dawn high heaven's ford to leave;</p>
<p>To earth's extremity I came at eve.</p>
<p>On phoenix wings the dragon pennons lay;</p>
<p>With plumage bright they flew to lead the way.</p>
<p>I crossed the quicksand with its treach'rous flood,</p>
<p>Beside the burning river, red as blood;</p>
<p>To bridge the stream my dragons huge I bade,</p>
<p>Invoked the emperor of the west to aid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way was long, precipitous in view;</p>
<p>I bade my train a different path pursue.</p>
<p>There where the heaven fell we turned a space,</p>
<p>And marked the western sea as meeting-place.</p>
<p>A thousand chariots gathred in my train,</p>
<p>With axles full abreast we drove amain;</p>
<p>Eight horses drew the carriages behind;</p>
<p>The pennons shook like serpents in the wind.</p>
<p>I lowered flags, and from my whip refrained;</p>
<p>My train of towering chariots I restrained.</p>
<p>I sang the odes. I trod a sacred dance,</p>
<p>In revels wild my last hour to enhance.</p>
<p>Ascending where celestial heaven blazed,</p>
<p>On native earth for the last time we gazed;</p>
<p>My slaves were sad, my steeds all neighed in grief,</p>
<p>And gazing back, the earth they would not leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Since in that kingdom all my virtue spurn,</p>
<p>Why should I for the royal city yearn?</p>
<p>Wide though the world, no wisdom can be found.</p>
<p>I'll seek the stream where once the sage was drowned.</p>
